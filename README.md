# PNEUMONIA-and-COVID-19-Detection-Flask-and-Golang-Application-based-on-Chest-X-rays
We trained a convolutional neural network model from scratch to classify and detect the presence of pneumonia and covid19 from a collection of chest X-ray image samples.

# Dataset
The dataset for the project was gathered from:

Chest X-ray images (5000 images) were obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

# Classification Reports for Chest X-rays:

Model has been trained with loss, accuracy of 1.5673713684082031, 0.7483552694320679
